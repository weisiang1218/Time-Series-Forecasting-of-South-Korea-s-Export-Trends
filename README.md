# Time-Series Forecasting of Export Trends

This project involves time-series forecasting of South Koreaâ€™s export trends over a 3-year horizon. The forecasting models used include SARIMA and ARIMA combined with STL decomposition.

## About

The purpose of this project is to analyze and forecast export trends using statistical time-series methods. The notebook contains detailed analysis, model fitting, diagnostics, and forecasting results.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization  
- Decomposition of time series using STL  
- Forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA models  
- Model evaluation and comparison  
- Forecast visualization for export trends over the next 3 years
